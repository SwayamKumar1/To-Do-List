# 📝 To-Do List App (Python)

A simple **command-line To-Do List application** built in Python.  
It helps you stay organized by allowing you to add, delete, search, filter, and mark tasks as done — with support for priorities and due dates.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks with **priority (High/Medium/Low)** and **due date**
- View all tasks with status ✅ or ❌
- Search tasks by keyword
- Filter tasks by:
  - Priority
  - Status (done/pending)
  - Due date
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Data is saved in **JSON file**, so tasks persist even after program exit
